# BEPT-Official.github.io
The official BEPT website hosted by GitHub!

Note from Lead Dev: Yes, I know this is open source and anyone can steal this code, but still it might be a great way to show people how to code a site in HTML! You may also take inspiration from this if you'd like, just don't directly copy-and-paste my repo just like that :(!
